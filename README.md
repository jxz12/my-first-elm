How to run:
-----------

1. Download elm
1. compile with `elm make src/Main.elm --output=www/js/elm.js --optimize` in the terminal, in the current directory.
...
3. Profit

Load the index file on a web browser, probably by right-clicking the file, and selecting a web browser to
open it

(Or on a Mac: `open -a Safari.app index.html`)

(Or for hot reloading `elm-live src/Main.elm --open -d www -- --output=www/js/elm.js`)

# Jonny's noob notes
## Elm
* every function only takes one parameter, and then is curried into another function using [] (like in Q)
* the parameter can be a list, in which case you still use `[]` but you can put commas between elements
* the dict type is called 'records' and uses `{}`

### Resources
* https://guide.elm-lang.org/
  * the 'official' guide, learn by example top-down
* https://elmprogramming.com/
  * learn bottom-up

### types
* yea! normal types are like enums, and then everything else is just an object
* pattern matching allows us to think of types as a sort of state machine
  * that's why the cardinality of `|` types is addition since it is an 'or'
  * https://guide.elm-lang.org/appendix/types_as_sets
* each type can have a 'type variable' which is like a generic type
  * e.g. `List a` is a list filled with type a
  * this is lower-case and defined BEFORE the = sign, e.g. in `type Foo bar = ...` the `bar` is the generic
* the purpose of type alias when applied to Record type is to constrain what is in there
* `()` is an empty tuple which counts as a type! Crazy

* you can have a type with [only one variant](https://github.com/mdgriffith/elm-animator/blob/master/examples/Mario.elm#L84) which then [doesn't need a `case`](https://github.com/mdgriffith/elm-animator/blob/master/examples/Mario.elm#L376) statement

### statements
* `case` ... `of` handles addition (enum) types
* `let` ... `in` is temporary variables for convenience
* `if` ... `then` ... `else` is what it usually is

### anonymous functions
* a bracket but the first argument has a backslash, e.g. `(\foo -> foo + 1) 3`
* _beware_ because if the types don't match then the only error you'll get is 'not expected'

### Lists
* `foldl` takes a function which has current and agg in it, just like `reduce` in js

### pipes
these two are equivalent:
```
    , Html.div [] (List.foldl (\elem result -> result ++ [treeToDivRecursive elem] ) [] children)
```
and
```
    , children
      |> List.foldl (\elem result -> result ++ [treeToDivRecursive elem] ) []
      |> Html.div []
```

but the second one arranges it into more manageable steps

This piping is usually why functions like [Dict.insert](https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm/core/latest/Dict#insert) have Dict as the last parameter as well as the return type, because that lends itself more towards chaining them together
* e.g. `dict |> Dict.insert "a" "b" |> Dict.insert "c" "d"` will insert twice into `dict`

### Browser.application
* `subscriptions` is for javascript events such as onTimer and websockets

### JSON
* Json.Decode.* is how to parse json objects (e.g. events from onSubmit)
* here you can use `<|` to make it read nicely

### Commands and Subscriptions

* a command can be returned by an update
  * e.g. a button click returns an event that updates the model, the model then returns a command which makes a HTTP request, this request can then return another event to update the model again
  * it is called a command because you are *commanding* the Html/Javascript runtime to do something
  * it then automatically hooks in the callback to update the model for you
* a subscription *listens* to the runtime
  * a sub needs to return an event to update the model

## Maths
* DisplayEvent is passed into the Display.view as an argument
  * that is because it is used as a converter from Display.Event to DisplayEvent
  * this works because the type *is a constructor*
  * the converted type is then pattern matched in the Main.update to update the Display.Model (which is stored in Main.model.display)

* Math.Tree vs Math.Symbol
  * symbolicate adds brackets that allow transformation into linearised form or standard notation
    * standard notation is sort of like the top-down view of the AST
  * the treatment of functions like "+" or "-" is a bit like __syntactic sugar__
    * the sugar is to place them in between arguments while adding precedence rules to their evaluation
    * this is how humans decided to write equations
  * This then makes it easy to convert into the <div>s shown in the equation
    * that is why collapsedView_ is such a short function!

* Parsing
  * the reason "+" is the name of a function instead of a pattern-matched type is that it IS actually just the name of a function. It is nothing special and should not be treated as such. Only when you apply the rules do you actually care about the name, at which point it *should* be a string
  * state is everywhere, and it gets passed in pattern matching bits usually as just `s`
  * in each Function there are `args` and `parameters`, and the reason they exist is so that we can display a semicolon between them. This is useful for things like log where the base is a parameter, NOT an arg
    * the semicolon will also be in the syntax

* the reason expressive type systems are nice are that it is like you are asserting things everywhere
  * cya later Herb Sutter who recommends adding manual asserts everywhere to your C++

* tree operations
  * deleteSubTree also has to be recursive because we have to clear out the helper ParentMap_

* commutative vs associative
  * matrix multiplication is NOT commutative, but is associative
  * rock-paper-scissors is NOT associate, but is commutative (winner-stays-on RPS https://math.stackexchange.com/a/1549811)

### brainstorming
* when you are solving an equation, e.g. x^2 + 2x + 1 = 0, it is only for a specific CONTEXT
* Formal Rules of Algebra are substitutions valid for ALL CONTEXTS
    * https://faculty.ung.edu/mgoodroe/PriorCourses/Math_0999_General/The%20Formal%20Rules%20of%20Algebra.pdf
    * solving an equation is performing an operation on BOTH sides and then one of them cancelling out
      * these could be tabs on the left
    * by default we want to visualise the associative rule because otherwise you end up with tall trees that are unwieldy
* creation is not the same as modification

### animation
we also want to animate the linearised view
look at https://github.com/3b1b/manim for inspiration

* [elm-style-animation](https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/mdgriffith/elm-style-animation/3.5.5) was the precursor to [elm-animator](https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/mdgriffith/elm-animator/latest/) which was made by the same guy
  * here is the [blog post](https://discourse.elm-lang.org/t/announcing-elm-animator/5443) with more useful links


* you start with an `Animator.Animator`
  * using `Animator.watching`
  * it is a bit confusing that this takes the *empty* `Animator.animator` as an argument, but that's so that you can chain them together `|>`
    * this should just be a list of things to watch tbh

* MODEL: `Animator.Timeline a`
  * in the `init` you use `Animator.init a`

* UPDATE:
  * in the normal update we 'add keyframes' to the aforementioned timeline
    * the position of the keyframe is decided by `Animator.go`
  * also need a subscription to advance the timeline
    * but it is `Animator.toSubscription Tick model animator` not `Time.every 1000 Tick`
      * where `animator` your custon `Animator.Animator`
    * this will emit the Tick msg which then gets fed into the update
      * `Tick newTime -> ( Animator.update newTime animator model , Cmd.none )`

* VIEW:
  * here is where you decide the effect of the keyframes you added
  * e.g. to animate opacity, you use `Animator.Inline.opacity` which takes the `Timeline a` and then mapping of that state to an opacity value
    * this means that it needs to be very efficient to extract the value from that state, i.e. we cannot traverse the whole tree for each attribute we'd like to animate, especially because every single node will need many attributes animated
    * that means the state needs to be the layed out coordinates already
